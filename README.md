Heres the fnaf lore made by Valentine:
* The story starts with two men named Henry and William who were good friends before William started his descent into madness. The men created a small restaurant named “Fredbears Family Dinner” which served pizza and entertainment via two animatronics. These animatronics were named Fredbear and Springbonnie, an important detail about these machines is that they were springlock suits, making it so that they could not only perform on stage but also be worn as suits.
